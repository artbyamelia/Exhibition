<div class="ex1">
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;" class="p3"> My name is Amelia Ford, and I am thrilled to share my artistic journey in this exhibition in Old Main at Wayne State University. This collection, titled "Junior to Senior" represents the evolution of my work from junior year to senior year, a transformative period in my life. It was during this time that I made the significant decision to shift from being a theatre major to pursuing graphic design. This change opened new doors for me, allowing me to rediscover my creative voice and hone my artistic identity. As a graphic design major, I was required to take core art classes that challenged me to experiment with different techniques and mediums. These classes became a turning point, helping me shape my unique style and explore the narratives I wanted to share. Growing up with ADHD and Autism, I’ve always experienced the world through a lens that values detail, nuance, and unique perspectives. Art has always been my sanctuary—a space where I can process my thoughts and communicate what words sometimes cannot. This exhibition captures the essence of my creative journey, highlighting themes that are deeply personal to me. My work incorporates elements of social justice, mental health awareness, and social satire, often interwoven with a touch of "weirdness" or "cuteness". I want my art to be more than just visually engaging; I aim to spark conversations, provoke thought, and encourage my audience to question their assumptions. Whether it elicits confusion, joy, discomfort, or even anger, I believe that every reaction is valid and meaningful. After all, the most challenging conversations often stem from confronting the uncomfortable. Below, you’ll find pictures of all the art being showcased and a map of the exhibition to guide you through my creative journey. I hope this experience inspires you to see the world through a different lens, just as creating this work has done for me. </p>
